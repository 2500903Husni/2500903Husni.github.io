## Hi, I'm Husni

I'm a student in Singapore Institute Technology (SIT) persuing in Bachelor of Science in Applied Computing specialisation in Financial Technology.  Previously, I graduated from Nanyang Polytechnic with a diploma in Business and Financial Technology.My hobby is lifting weights and I'm a big fan of listening to music while lifting weights. I also enjoy playing video games during my free time. I'm passionate about technology and finance, and I'm excited to explore the intersection of these fields through my studies and future career.
